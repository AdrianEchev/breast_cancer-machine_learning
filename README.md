This repository contains data science abilities to clean and transform data to improve the results of the included machine learning algorithms.

In this project, we use binary classification algorithms to predict if the condition of the breast cancer is either benign (B) or malignant (M). The use of Exploratory Data Analysis will give us the benefit of analyzing our data apply transformations to obtain better evaluation results. Additionally, we must choose the appropiate machine learning models to predict the diagnosis.
